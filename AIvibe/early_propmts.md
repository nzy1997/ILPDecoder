Investigate how to handle integer programming problems in Python.
I am quite familiar with the relationship between JuMP and solvers like SCIP and HiGHS in Julia. Is there an analogous setup in Python?
Are there any Python packages for integer programming applied to QEC (quantum error correction)?
I want to write a package that solves QEC decoding problems using integer programming. The intended functionality includes:
Similar to PyMatching, it should be able to directly decode from a parity check matrix, or decode from a detector error model generated by Stim.
A modular solver backend that allows users to choose and configure solvers according to their needs, similar to JuMP.
Please help me design a development plan.
